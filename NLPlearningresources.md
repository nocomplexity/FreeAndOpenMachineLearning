NLP Learning resources
======================

There is a large overlap between machine learning and current NLP
technology. But is makes sense to outline specific NLP resources
separate. This to make searching for good open NLP resources easier.

So this section is an opinionated list of great NLP learning resources.
Of course also only resources that are open, so only resources published
using a Creative Commons license (cc-by mostly) or other real open
licenses are included. So all references are open access resources.
