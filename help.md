This publication on FOSS machine learning is created to be shared as
much as possible. This to make sure machine learning remains a full open
technology that can be used by everyone. And remember FOSS machine
learning is all about Freedom. So commercial development of Free and
Open Machine Learning technology is very important for sustainable
development of a healthy FOSS machine learning ecosystem. And of course
FOSS machine learning means using open principles.

You can contribute to FOSS machine learning in a simple way. This
publication is created to be shared as much as possible. So please:

This publication is created as a starting and living document to support
FOSS machine learning. So this publication is likely to be incomplete or
outdated if not maintained. I will update it frequently but I also need
your help. So I encourage all information professionals to help to
improve this Free and Open Machine Guide.

FOSS machine learning is crucial for open innovation the coming years.
Using and applying Machine learning technology should be in reach for
all companies worldwide with no strings attached.

The core focus in this first publication was to explained why FOSS
machine learning is needed and showed that you or your company can make
the choice to use open machine learning. Even for real business use
cases.

Using FOSS building blocks for machine learning does not mean that you
cannot benefit from the great advantages that some (Cloud)Companies
offer. FOSS machine learning is an enabler for business innovation. So
guard your freedom, but also take responsibility for the freedom of
others that benefit from your machine learning application(s).

In a next version of this publication your input is needed to improve
the practical use of FOSS machine learning in practice. So if you:

-   Like to share your real life experience with FOSS machine learning.
-   Want to share your experience on using FOSS machine learning tools
    or ML building blocks.
-   Like to share resources that should be mentioned in this FOSS
    machine learning publication.
-   Discuss the content so it gets better. We do discussion on-line and
    off-line (meetups).
