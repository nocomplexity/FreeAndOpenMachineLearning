NLP Learning resources
========================

There is a large overlap between machine learning and current NLP technology. But is makes sense to outline specific NLP resources seperate. This to make searching for good open NLP resources easier.

So this section an opinionated list of great NLP learning resources. Of course also only resources that are open, so only resources published using a Creative Commons license (cc-by mostly) or other real open license are included. So all references are open access resources.
