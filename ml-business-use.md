# Machine Learning for Business Problems


Reading and talking about futuristic potential options for machine
learning is nice and should be done. But applying machine learning today
for your business is where you can make a real difference. This section
is focussed on applying machine learning for real business use cases.

Example use cases that are possible with current available FOSS machine
learning building blocks are outlined. And some real world business use
cases where machine learning is applied are shown. This to give you
inspiration and information on possible options for your business.

Be aware that besides technology more is needed for applying machine
learning in a business with success. This section gives you some more in
depth input on organisational factors that should be taken into account
when applying machine learning for real business use.

## When to use machine learning?


Before starting and applying machine learning for solving business
problems you must be aware that machine learning is not a tool for every
problem. Or to put it even more clear: In most cases applying machine
learning is overkill, too expensive, does not work, and other
traditional software solutions make far more sense. So the short answer
for most use case is: **do not use machine learning.** Keep it simple!
Using machine learning is a complex and risky journey and it makes your
business more complex.

But the temptation to use machine learning to solve complex problems is
too promising to ignore. So you should try it. Preferably by using a
fast innovation project with minimal cost and no strings attached. If
only try it to see if is has real some real opportunities for your use
case. But be aware that machine learning doesn't give
perfect answers or a perfect solution. Risk will always exist,so you
should get a feeling on the likelihood of a risk occurring.

In some use cases machine learning can save you a lot of time and can
make things possible that are out of reach using normal traditional
software approaches.

With the use of machine learning it is possible to learn from patterns
and conditions to get new solid outcomes or predictions based on new
data. Machine learning is able to learn from changes in patterns (data)
at a pace that the human mind can not. This makes that machine learning
as a technology is useful for a set of use cases were learning from data
is possible or needed. So this is one reason why machine learning only
makes sense for a limited class of use cases.

Machine learning should not be used for use cases that can easily be
solved in another way. For example do not use machine learning driven
solutions if your use case matches one of the following criteria:

-   If it's possible to structure a set of rules or "if-then scenarios"
    to handle your problem entirely, then there is usually no need to
    use machine learning at all.
-   Your problem can be solved using traditional statistical
    tools(algorithms) and software.

Machine learning is an appropriate tool to use for problems whose only
commonality is that they involve statistical inference. This means that
problems where machine learning makes real sense have e.g. the following
characteristics:

-   Classification challenges. E.g., is this a picture of a cat or a
    gorilla? Looks this human happy? Is this person writing emotional
    replies on twitter?
-   Clustering challenges. E.g., group all cat pictures by ones that are
    most similar.
-   Reinforcement learning challenges. E.g., learn to predict how people
    behave when they book a holiday with a large discount. Are you
    willing to buy something you do not need without discount?

A good question to ask is: Can this problem be solved by looking at
statistical outcomes? If the answer is yes, use traditional statistical
software and avoid machine learning directly. Avoid complexity at all
cost before trying to find if using machine learning is a viable option.

In general: All areas where there is a lot of data *and* too much data
for manual inspection are candidates for applying machine learning.

So summarized for most business problems using machine learning should
be avoided. Like blockchain or other industry IT buzzwords: Avoid the
trap of using a solution and finding a problem to use it on! A
particularly bad use case for machine learning is when the problem can
be described using clear and precise mathematical equations. Only when a
problem can not be described using clear and existing mathematical
equations and an outcome can be predicted using large numbers of input
data, then the use of machine learning should be considered.

When you want to apply machine learning for your business use cases you
need to develop a solid architecture before starting. A standard
solution for your business use case does not exist. Your company and
your context is unique. So for real and significant business advantage
you should also develop your own machine learning enabled application or
ML powered information system. Machine learning is just a component in
the complete system architecture needed. But a good and simple overall
architecture when applying machine learning is needed. Especially since
all developed solutions deployed in production need maintenance. In the
section \'ML Reference Architecture\' a view of the complete system
architecture is given.

The usage of a Cloud (SaaS or ML-SaaS) machine learning solution will
not always give you the competitive advantage you are searching for.
This because standard solutions only work on standard use cases. Most
use cases are unique. So if your business is special, your data is
unique and your use case is unique than your own developed machine
learning driven application should give you a head start and competitive
advantage. In the section ' Machine learning reference architecture' an
in depth outline is given on the various system building blocks that are
needed for applying machine learning in a successful way. Make use of
the machine learning reference architecture outlined in this publication
to create your own ML enabled solution faster.

In order to solve business problems using machine learning technology
you need to have an organisation structure that powers innovation and
experimenting. Experimenting with machine learning should be simple and
can be done in a short time. But this requires a business culture with
an innovation approach where learning and playing with new technology is
possible without predefined rules.

## Common business use cases


### Healthcare

Healthcare is due to the large amounts of data available a perfect
domain for solving challenges using machine learning. E.g. a challenging
question for machine learning for healthcare is: Given a patient's
electronic medical record data, can we prevent a person getting sick?

Machine learning is more and more used for automatic diagnostics. This
can be data provided by X-ray scans or data retrieved from blood and
tissue samples. Machine learning has already proven to be valuable in
detecting and predicting diseases for real people. But beware already
sensors and camera data in public spaces are used to gather data, also
for healthcare related use cases without your approval.

Predictive tasks for healthcare is maybe the way to keep people
healthier and lower healthcare cost. The transformation from making
people better towards preventing people getting sick is long and hard,
since this means a real shift for the healthcare industry.

But given a large set of training data of de-identified medical records
it is already possible to predict interesting aspects of the future for
a patient that is not in the training set.

Machine learning applications for healthcare are also to create better
medicines by making use of all the data already available.

### Language translation

Machine learning is already used for automatic real-time message
translation. E.g. Rocket Chat (The OSS Slack alternative,
<https://rocket.chat/> ) is using machine learning for real time
translation.

Since language translation needs context and lots of data, typically
these use cases are often NLP driven. Language translation as speech
recognition is a typical NLP application. Natural language processing
(NLP) is area of machine learning that operates on (human)text and
speech. See the section on NLP in this book for more use cases and
insight in the specific NLP technologies.

Other areas for language translation are speech recognition. Some great
real time machine learning driven application already exists.

When building speech recognition machine learning applications you
discover that data needed for speech recognition is not quite open. To
create voice systems you need an extremely large amount of voice data.
Most of the data used by large companies isn't available to the majority
of people. E.g. Amazon , Microsoft and Google offer great APIs but you
interact with a black-box model. Also speech recognition needs openness
and freedom. Mozilla launched the Common Voice project in 2017. A project to
make voice recognition data and APIs open and accessible to everyone.
Contributing to this great project is simple: Go to https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en
and speak some sentences and validate some.
All you need is a browser and a few minutes to contribute so everyone
can make use of this technology in the future.

### Chat bots

Currently all major tech companies like Amazon(Alexis), Google, Apple
(Siri) have built a smart chatbot for the consumer market. Creating a
chatbot (e.g. IRQ bot) was not new and difficult, however building a
real 'intelligent' chat bot that has learning capabilities is another
challenge.

Machine learning powered chatbots with real human like voices help
computers communicate with humans. But algorithms still have a hard time
trying to figure out what you are saying, because context and tone of
voice is hard to get right. Even for us humans, communication with other
humans is most of the time hard. So building a smart chatbot that
understands basic emotions in your voice is difficult. Machine learning
isn't advanced enough yet to carry on a dialogue without help, so a lot
of the current chatbot software needs to be hand-coded.

### eCommerce Recommendation systems

A well known application of machine learning for eCommerce systems is a
machine learning enabled recommendation system system. Whether you buy a
book, trip, music or visit a movie: On all major online ecommerce sites
you get a recommendation for a product that seems to fit your interest
perfectly. Of course the purpose is to drive up the sale, but the algorithms used are good examples of still evolving machine learning
algorithms for recommendation systems.

Examples of these systems are:

-   Selling tickets to concerts based on your profile.
-   NetFlix or cinema systems to make sure you stay hooked on watching
    more series and films you like.
-   Finding similar products in an eCommerce environment with a great
    chance you buy it. E.g. similar hotels, movies, books, etc.

### Quality inspection and improvement

When computer vision technologies are combined with machine learning
capabilities new opportunities arise. Examples of real world
applications are:

-   Inspecting tomatoes (and other fruit / vegetables) for quality and
    diseases.
-   Inspecting quality of automatic created constructions (e.a.
    Constructions made by robots)

### Vision

Since vision is captured in data machine learning is a great tool for
building applications using vision (images, movies) technology. E.g.:

-   Face detection. Writing software to detect faces and do recognition
    is very very hard to do using traditional programming methods.
-   Image classification. In the old days we were happy when software
    was able to distinguish a cat and dog. In 2018 far more advanced
    applications are possible. E.g. giving details on all kind of
    aspects of photos. E.g. when you organize a conference you can use
    software to check the amount of suits or hoodies visiting your
    conference. Which is of course great for marketing.
-   Image similarity. Given an image, the goal of an image similarity
    model is to find \"similar\" images. Just like in image
    classification, deep learning methods have been shown to give
    incredible results on this challenging problem. However, unlike in
    image similarity, there isn\'t a need to generate labelled images
    for model creation. This model is completely unsupervised.
-   Object Detection. Object detection is the task of simultaneously
    classifying (what) and localizing (where) object instances in an
    image.

### Financial services

-   Real-time trade: Like bidding sites for online advertising and stock
    exchange markets are more and more driven by software algorithms.
    Knowing this you must be a fool if you take part on a stock exchange
    market without the power these automated machine learning driven
    systems have. You will never earn anything\...
-   Banking and credit services: More and more banks and large financial
    companies are using their data to get more profit out of existing
    customers. Based on a smart combination of banking data and
    financial transaction data, your bank knows better than you can
    imagine how to make even more profit from their customers.

### Marketing

-   Marketing and acquisition: By analysing mass amounts of data you can
    better target your existing and potential users for your service.
    Machine learning makes a large difference here, as proven by Google
    and Facebook (both ad-service companies in essence). Analysing works
    using machine learning works well for consumer markets where user
    data and user behaviour data is widespread and for sale. And since
    tracking users on the internet is the number one data leak almost
    all data is available somewhere. Also business to business marketing
    is perfect to automate using machine learning. This is because also
    here the only input needed is often data.

Of course if you do care about privacy and embrace the values of Free
and Open machine learning the marketing use cases for machine learning
are almost impossible to create due to privacy issues involved.

### HR services

-   HR management and HR services: Finding the right new employing,
    talent management, performance management all tangible HR work is
    powered by ML software more and more. Even the scary face and voice
    recognition tools are used to check if your new employee matches
    your ideal profile. Until HR is fully automated ML powered software
    helps HR professionals to improve decision-making and create more
    efficient ways to interact with employees.

When using machine learning for HR services be aware of bias issues in
using datasets. Bias when hire new personnel is for humans already
difficult to handle. But you do not want a machine learning application
that only selects people based on old paradigms in society.

### Predicting services

-   Predicting services: Almost all predicting services in all business
    domains can benefit from the combination of large data sets and
    using machine learning algorithms. E.g. you can empower predicting
    services by using weather data (historical and new), financial and
    demographic data and local production data to find out in more
    detail how your next sales campaign goes. But prediction is also
    possible on failures on production lines, where historical data is
    combined with sensor data.

### Software

A holy grail for software developers is of course creating machine
learning algorithms that creates software for use cases that require
expensive and complex human programming work.

In recent years some real progress for using machine learning for
creating software is made. Use cases seen are e.g.:

-   Software code improvement: Manual programming is hard and error
    prone. By training machine learning on a large code base to learn
    the model what 'bugs' are, it is possible to use machine learning to
    prevent programming bugs in new developed software code. In this way
    code can not be committed since the automated checks provided
    spotted an error. Detecting a bug before software is tested and
    deployed is far cheaper than correcting errors in code when a
    program is already released. A game development company has used
    this application of machine learning for real with success already.
    (reference <http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ubisoft-commit-assist-ai>
    )
-   Creating new software programs: Based on a problem it is proven by
    different companies that software can be generated instead of manual
    crafted (programmed). Feeding a algorithm massive inputs of examples
    programs it is possible to generate a new program based for your
    specific problem. Of course this application of machine learning is
    still in its early phase. It is also questionable if this
    application of machine learning makes real sense since the new
    paradigm of machine learning is no longer program a solution but
    create a program outcome based on input data.

### Security

-   Email spam filters. Although simple rules can and should be applied,
    the enormous creativity of spammers and the amount send good
    fighting spam is a solid use case for a supervised machine learning
    problem.
-   Network filtering. Due to the learning capability of machine
    learning network security devices are improved using machine
    learning techniques.
-   Fraud detection. Fraud detection is possible using enormous data and
    searching for strange patterns.

Besides fraud detection machine learning can also be applied for IT
security detections since intrusion detection systems and virus scanners
are more and more shipped with self learning algorithms. Also Complex
financial fraud schemes can be easily detected using predictive machine
learning models.

### Privacy

Privacy can be protected using machine learning. E.g. images can be made
invisible by using a machine learning enabled application. A scientific
proof is demonstrated and the code is named 'DeepPrivacy'. In the
section with a collection of Computer Vision Building Blocks for more
information on this SBB.) The technique used is based on Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for face anonymization. It\'s far from
perfect, but usable for most low quality images.

```{warning}
Warning:Besides protecting privacy machine learning is still too often a privacy
nightmare.
```

### Risk and compliance

-   Evaluating risks can be done using large amounts of data. Natural
    language processing techniques can be used to validate highly
    automatic if your company meets regulations. Since audit and
    inspecting work is mostly based on standardized rules performed by
    knowledge workers this kind of work can be automated using machine
    learning techniques.
-   Detecting danger and safety risks. E.g. for autonomous vehicles
    (robots). More and more machine learning software is developed to
    make transport safer for us humans.

## Business Examples


Applications for real business use of machine learning to solve real
tangible problems are growing at a rapid pace. To outline some use cases
that have been realized using machine learning technology, this
paragraph summarize some real world cases to get some inspiration. So in
this section some worth mentioning exiting real business examples for
companies that really make use of new ML solutions possible.

-   Medical researchers are using machine learning to assess a person's
    cardiovascular risk of a heart attack and stroke.
-   Air Traffic Controllers are using TensorFlow to predict flight
    routes through crowded airspace for safe and efficient landings.
-   Engineers are using TensorFlow to analyse auditory data in the
    rainforest to detect logging trucks and other illegal activities.
-   Scientists in Africa are using TensorFlow to detect diseases in
    Cassava plants to improve yield for farmers.
-   Finding free parking space. <http://www.peazy.in> has developed an
    app using machine learning to assist with finding a free parking
    space in crowded cities.
-   All kinds of card games. With the use of the FOSS RLCard toolkit
    (see open ML Software section) the use of Reinforcement Learning
    (RL) in card games is possible.
-   AI Driven Logos. An AI solution which selects the best possible
    logos for your brand based on a large number of designs it has seen
    over time. Check <https://www.designwithai.com/>
-   Cardiac Ultrasound Software. The software, called Caption Guidance,
    is an accessory to compatible diagnostic ultrasound systems and uses
    artificial intelligence to help the user capture images of a
    patient's heart that are of acceptable diagnostic quality. Approved
    for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

## Business Challenges


Applying machine learning for real business use cases is complex and
difficult.

Common business challenges when applying machine learning in business
products or services are e.g.:

-   Determining when applying machine learning is a good choice for
    solving a business problem.
-   Getting the right data and preparation of the data to be used for
    training a machine learning model.
-   Dealing with privacy, security and safety aspects.
-   Engineering solid and maintainable machine learning applications.
    Designing, creating and debugging machine learning applications is
    specialized IT work.
-   Dealing with terrible math and statistics foundations. Of course
    most software building blocks keep this away from you, but you must
    make choices that require some more in depth knowledge of the
    foundations behind the chosen algorithms used.
-   Have access to skilled IT engineers. Not only machine learning
    engineers are needed, but also good engineers that are skilled in
    setting up IT environments. This accounts for cloud and also for on
    premise environments. Choices that are possible for machine learning
    cloud environments are often not trivial, unless you have an
    unlimited credit card.

The number one challenge is: How to integrate machine learning into your
current business operations and products in order to really benefit from
this technology?

Normal IT projects have a bad reputation. Projects are often delayed and
do not deliver what was needed. Machine learning projects are not
different. In fact machine learning projects are still complex and risky
IT projects. So an agile approach is recommended to reduce risks.

Integration of machine learning software pipelines, especially when it
also involves digital integration between companies and systems of
different companies is known to be hard, complex and make you poor if
handled wrong. If you have a bad track record when it comes to executing
traditional IT projects, machine learning projects have the same
challenges with a couple of new real high risks elements.

Machine learning is not a logical and intuitive way to solve problems.
For many engineers and software programmers solving problems using a
machine learning approach is against the learned and trained intuition.
So training and building an intuition for what tool should be leveraged
to solve a problem is needed for engineers involved. At a minimum
engineers involved should be aware of available machine learning
algorithms and machine learning building blocks (SBBs) and the
trade-offs and constraints of each one. This publication contains an
overview of the typical algorithms and an overview of diverse machine
learning FOSS building blocks available. This increases the insights and
improves the awareness of available options.

Machine learning needs trial and error before it works well. But
debugging a machine learning application is a real complex challenge. An
endless number of factors must be taken into account. Not only technical
but even more from a business perspective. What risks in outcomes
are acceptable? You need insights in the context where the results are used
in order to evaluate if machine learning results are usable enough. When
you want to improve the output you can face problems e.g. the following
problems:

-   Is there a bug in the used software framework?
-   Is the data quality below an acceptable level?
-   Is the chosen algorithm the right choice?
-   Are other IT issues influencing the outcome, e.g. performance?
-   With machine learning finding bugs and working on optimizations is
    almost 'exponentially' harder due to the complex nature of the
    various aspects involved. So to figure out what is wrong when things
    don't work as expected can take far more time than available.
-   Are the risks for business use acceptable? For live saving systems
    you should make other choices than for a marketing system.

## Business capabilities


To take advantage of machine learning your organisation needs to have or
develop the needed capabilities. Before starting a proof of concept with machine learning you need to dive into the subject and
options. *Warning*: Don't fall for a vendor hype. So beware of demo\'s
and courses of vendors who sell you perfect SaaS ML solutions. If a
promise for new business innovation based on a new machine learning
application seems too good to be true: It often is.

Only you know your business systems, your requirements, your financial
objectives, your customers and thus the right trade-offs to make. Good
and simple tools can make the process for using machine learning easier.
But tools are no magic bullet. You still need to have to integrate
machine learning outcomes with your business products or services.

To use the power of machine learning collaboration is needed. So the
focus should also be on solving business problems and not only IT
challenges.

The following capabilities are often needed to successfully apply
machine learning for your business use case:

-   Capability to experiment and learn. So a real learning culture.
-   Managers, architects, developers and engineers with an open mindset.
    So open for learning and experimenting.
-   Descent knowledge of key quality aspects involved. E.g. privacy,
    safety and security. You must take privacy, safety and security requirements serious from the start. Do it by design. It can initially take some
    extra time. But once key safeguards are in place experimenting with
    data and machine learning outcomes are possible with lower risks. So
    make sure you involve some privacy and security experts from the
    start.
-   Solid business innovation strategy, innovation management system
    (process and people) available.

If your goal is to use machine learning to reduce cost by automating
human workflows make sure everyone shares this goal upfront.

## Business ethics


When machine learning algorithms make decisions that affect human lives,
what standards of transparency, openness and accountability should apply
to those decisions? If the decisions are \"wrong\", who is legally and
ethically responsible?

There are always good and bad uses for any technology. This accounts
also for machine learning technology. Working with machine learning can,
will and must raise severe ethical questions. Machine learning can be
used in many bad ways. Saying that you 'Don\'t be evil' , like the
[mission statement of Google](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil>) was for decades, does
not save you. Any business that uses machine learning should develop a
process in order to handle ethical issues before they arrive. And
ethical questions will arise.

A growing number of experts believe that a third revolution occurs
during the 21st century, through the invention of machines with
intelligence which surpasses our own intelligence. The rapid progress in
machine learning technology turns out to be input for all kind of
disaster scenarios. When the barriers to apply machine learning are
lowered one of the fears is that knowledge work and various mental tasks
currently performed by humans become obsolete.

When machine learning develops and the border with artificial
intelligence will be approached many more philosophical and ethical
discussions will take place. One of the core question is: What is human
intelligence? But the more important question is: Who is responsible for
mistakes? The self learning algorithm? To put it in the context of
machine learning: What is the real value of human intelligence when
machine learning algorithms can take over many common mental tasks and
control tasks of humans? Who is responsible for accidents with
autonomous vehicles?

Many experts believe that there is a significant chance we develop
machines more intelligent than ourselves within a few decades. This
could lead to large, rapid improvements in human welfare, or mass
unemployment and poverty on a large scale. History learns that there are
good reasons to think that this could lead to disastrous outcomes for
our current societies. If machine learning research advances without
enough research work for security, safety and privacy, catastrophic
accidents are likely to occur. Or if we look back at history: Incidents
will occur since regulations are always developed afterwards with any new
technology.

With FOSS machine learning capabilities you should be able to take some
control over the rapid pace machine learning driven software is hitting
our lives. So instead of trying to stop developments it is
more productive to steer developments into a positive, safe, human centric
direction. So apply machine learning using a decent machine learning
architecture were also some critical ethical business questions are
addressed.

Advances within machine learning could lead to extremely positive
developments, presenting solutions to now-intractable global problems.
But applying machine learning without good architectures where ethical
questions are addressed, can pose severe risks. Humanity's superior intelligence is the sole reason that we are the dominant species on our planet. If technology with advanced
machine learning algorithms surpass humans in intelligence, then just as
the fate of gorillas currently depends on the actions of humans, the
fate of humanity may come to depend more on the actions of machines than
our own.

To address ethical questions for your machine learning solution you can use the high level framework with ethical
requirements below. All requirements are of equal importance, support
each other, and should be implemented and evaluated throughout the
system's lifecycle.

![ML Ethics requirements](/images/ml-ethical-requirements.png)

The framework of ethical requirements is part of the (draft)\'Ethics
Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI)\' from the
Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG)of the European
Commission.

Some basic common ethical questions for every machine learning
architecture are:

-   Bias in data sets. How do you weigh this? Are you fully aware of the
    impact?
-   Impact on your company.
-   Impact on your employees.
-   Impact on your customers (short and long term).
-   Impact on society.
-   Impact on available jobs and future man force needed.
-   Who is responsible and who is liable when the application developed
    using machine learning goes seriously wrong?
-   Do you and your customers find it acceptable if all kinds of data sources are
    combined to make more profit?
-   How transparent should you inform your customers on how privacy
    aspects are taken into account when using the machine learning
    software? Legal baselines, like the EU GDPR do not answer these
    ethical questions for you!
-   How transparent are you towards stakeholders regarding various
    direct and indirect risks factors involved when applying machine
    learning applications?
-   Who is responsible and liable when risks in your machine learning
    application do occur?

A lot of ethical questions come back to crucial privacy and other risks
questions like safety and security. We live in a digital world where our
digital traces are everywhere. Most of the time we are fully unaware. In
most western countries mass digital surveillance cameras generate great
data to be used for machine learning algorithms. This can be noble by
detecting diseases based on cameras, but all nasty use cases thinkable
are of course also under development. Continuous track and trace of
civilians including face recognition is not that uncommon any more!

The question regarding who is accountable for negative effects when you
use machine learning technology is simple to answer. You are!
Accountability is about holding individuals and organisations
responsible for how any machine learning enabled application is used.
But this is not trivial: The outcome of a machine learning application
system is the product of the software itself, or any single
decision-maker. This is because the success or failure of a ML enabled
system may be the product of one or several components. In most cases, a
system failure is the result of multiple factors, and responsibility is
not easily apportioned. So: If you do not understand the technology, the
impact for your business and on society you should not use it.

Legal regulations for applying machine learning are not yet developed.
Although some serious thinking is already be done in the field
regarding:

-   Safety and
-   Liability

Many governmental bodies promote adopting a risk-adapted regulatory
approach when it comes to ethical issues regarding algorithmic systems
(machine learning). History learns that risks based approaches that
depend on human discipline, especially in areas where safety issues are
clear, are fuel for disasters waiting to happen. It makes more sense to
adopt an approach that bans the human factor so risks can be calculated
using long proven scientific statistical methods.

Government rules and laws are formed during the transition the coming
decade. Machine learning techniques are perfect to use for autonomous
weapons. So drones will in near future decide based on hopefully
predefined rules when to launch a missile and when not. But as with all
technologies: Failures are going to happen! And we all hope it will not
hit us.

Using machine learning comes with responsibilities. These
responsibilities apply for all institutions that fund, develop, and
deploy ML based systems. So adopt ethical and open standards.
