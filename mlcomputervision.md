# ML Vision Solutions

Computer vision is a field within ML that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding of digital images and videos. Machine learning is a good match for image and video classification. Even realtime. **BUT** from a privacy point of view usage of these solutions is questionable at best. So never use ML solutions for real time image classification on humans in the wild.

## DeepFaceLab

## DeepPrivacy

<p>DeepPrivacy is a fully automatic anonymization technique for images.</p>



<p>The DeepPrivacy GAN never sees any privacy sensitive information, ensuring a fully anonymized image. It utilizes bounding box annotation to identify the privacy-sensitive area, and sparse pose information to guide the network in difficult scenarios. </p>



<p>DeepPrivacy detects faces with state-of-the-art detection methods. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870">Mask R-CNN</a> is used to generate a sparse pose information of the face, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10220">DSFD</a> is used to detect faces in the image. </p>



<p>The Github repository contains the source code for the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04538"><em>&#8220;DeepPrivacy: A Generative Adversarial Network for Face Anonymization&#8221;</em></a>, published at ISVC 2019.</p>

## FaceSwap

<p>FaceSwap is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos. </p>



<p>When faceswapping was first developed and published, the technology was groundbreaking, it was a huge step in AI development. It was also completely ignored outside of academia because the code was confusing and fragmentary. It required a thorough understanding of complicated AI techniques and took a lot of effort to figure it out. Until one individual brought it together into a single, cohesive collection. Before &#8220;deepfakes&#8221; these techniques were like black magic, only practiced by those who could understand all of the inner workings as described in esoteric and endlessly complicated books and papers. </p>



<p>Powered by Tensorflow, Keras and Python; Faceswap will run on Windows, macOS and Linux. And GPL licensed! </p>

## OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library
<p>OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.</p>
<p>The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.</p>
