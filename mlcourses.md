# ML courses


Learning machine learning does not have to be very expensive or time consuming. Great learning material for machine learning is licensed under a Creative Commons license. For starters but also people who are already more familiar with the key concepts.

This section presents an opinionated list of great machine learning learning resources. A lot of garbage is produced on the internet and even paid courses are often not that good. 

This list consist of very readable references and some great hands-on courses. Only resources that are real open, so resources published using a Creative Commons license (cc-by mostly) or other types of real open licensed material is included.

Most learning resources include hands-on tutorials. So be ready to learn how to use a [notebook](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/jupyterlab/intro.html), but most tutorials offer notebooks ready to use.


Everyone in the world should have access to high-quality machine learning resources. This to empower Free and Open Machine Learning. 

This list of [open](http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/) (Creative Commons licensed ) machine learning training resources contains resources for starters who never want to do ‘hands-on’. Openness for knowledge sharing means no user registration to read or play with the material is required.
