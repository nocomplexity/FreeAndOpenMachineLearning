# ML courses

Everyone in the world should have access to high-quality machine learning resources. This to empower Free and Open Machine Learning. 

This list of [open](http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/) (Creative Commons licensed ) machine learning training resources contains resources for starters who never want to do ‘hands-on’. Openness for knowledge sharing means no user registration to read or play with the material is required.

Never stop learning.
