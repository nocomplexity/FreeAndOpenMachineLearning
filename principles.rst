Principles for Machine learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every good architecture is based on principles, requirements and constraints.This machine learning reference architecture is designed to simplify the process of creating machine learning solutions. 



Principles are statements of direction that govern selections and implementations. That is, principles provide a foundation for decision making. A good principle hurts. Always good and common sense principles are nice for vision documents and policy makers. But when it comes to creating tangible solutions you must have principles that steer your development.

Principles are common used within business architecture and design and successful IT projects. A simple definition of a what a principle is:

* A principle is a qualitative statement of intent that should be met by the architecture.

Every solution architecture that for business use of a machine learning application should hold a minimum set of core business principles. 

Machine learning architecture principles are used to translate selected alternatives into basic ideas, standards, and guidelines for simplifying and organizing the construction, operation, and evolution of systems. In essence every good project is driven by principles. But since quality and cost aspects for machine learning driven application can have a large impact, a good machine learning solution is created based on principles. 

Key principles that are used for this Free and Open Machine learning reference architecture are:

1. The most important machine learning aspects must be addressed.
#. The quality aspects: Security, privacy and safety require specific attention.
#. The reference architecture should address all architecture building blocks from development till hosting and maintenance.
#. Translation from architecture building blocks towards FOSS machine learning solution building blocks should be easily possible.
#. The machine learning reference architecture is technology agnostics. The focus is on the outlining the conceptual architecture building blocks that make a machine learning architecture. 

For your use case you must make a more explicit variant of one of the above general principles. 

By writing down business principles is will be easier to steer discussions regarding quality aspects of the solution you are developing. Creating principles also makes is easier for third parties to inspect designs and solutions and perform risks analysis on the design process and the product developed.

Example Business principles for Machine Learning applications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In this section some general principles for machine learning applications. For your specific machine learning application use the principles that apply and make them SMART. So include implications and consequences per principle.



Collaborate
""""""""""""

Statement: Collaborate
Rationale: Successful creation of ML applications require the collaboration of people with different expertises. You need e.g. business experts, infrastructure engineers, data engineers and innovation experts.
Implications: Organisational and culture must allow open collaboration. 

Unfair bias
""""""""""""

Statement: Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias
Rationale: Machine learning algorithms and datasets can reflect, reinforce, or reduce unfair biases. Recognize fair from unfair biases is not simple, and differs across cultures and societies. However always make sure to avoid unjust impacts on sensitive characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, and political or religious belief. 
Implications: Be transparent about your data and training datasets. Make models reproducible and auditable.

Built and test for safety
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Statement: Built and test for safety.
Rationale:  Use safety and security practices to avoid unintended results that create risks of harm.  Design your machine learning driven systems to be appropriately cautious
Implications: Perform risk assessments and safety tests.

Privacy by design
""""""""""""""""""

Statement: Incorporate privacy by design principles.
Rationale: Privacy by principles is more than being compliant with legal constraints as e.g. EU GDPR. It means that privacy safeguards,transparency and control over the use of data should be taken into account from the start. This is a hard and complex challenge.
