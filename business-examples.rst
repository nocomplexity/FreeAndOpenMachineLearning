Business Examples  
---------------------

Applications for real business use of machine learning to solve real tangible problems is growing at a rapid pace. To outline some use cases that have been realized using machine learning technology, this paragraph summarize some real world cases to get some inspiration. So in this section some worth mentioning exiting real business examples for companies that really make use of new ML solutions possible.


* Medical researchers are using machine learning to assess a person’s cardiovascular risk of a heart attack and stroke. 

* Air Traffic Controllers are using TensorFlow to predict flight routes through crowded airspace for safe and efficient landings.

* Engineers are using TensorFlow to analyse auditory data in the rainforest to detect logging trucks and other illegal activities.

* Scientists in Africa are using TensorFlow to detect diseases in Cassava plants to improving yield for farmers.

* Finding free parking space. http://www.peazy.in has developed an app using machine learning to assist with finding a free parking space in crowded cities. 

* All kind of card games. With the use of the FOSS RLCard toolkit (see open ML Software section) the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in card games is possible.


* AI Driven Logos. An AI solution which selects the best possible logos for your brand based on a large number of designs it has seen over time. Check https://www.designwithai.com/ 

* Cardiac Ultrasound Software. The software, called Caption Guidance, is an accessory to compatible diagnostic ultrasound systems and uses artificial intelligence to help the user capture images of a patient’s heart that are of acceptable diagnostic quality. Approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
