# The business of AI

A lot of companies are currently active within the AI / LLM landscape. 

Most AI companies hardly make a profit. Large companies, like Google, Meta(Facebook) or Microsoft, are competing with new startups. But since the release of GPT by [openai.com](https://openai.com/) many new companies have entered the ML arena.

Most companies have a business model based on one of the following options:
* Selling consultancy
* Selling hosting
* Selling Enterprise solutions, including hosting so business can take simple and fast advantage of ML. Ofcourse: often the fast and simple turns out to be a fallacy.
* Selling training and courses.
* Selling user profiles since many companies offer a community. User profile information can be very valuable for certain companies. Besides recruiting, also selling additional services to a selected group can be very lucrative.
Selling a platform and services. Often the ‘free’ tier is to attract developers, but the gold is to sell ML platform services to enterprises and governmental organizations.

Truth is: Almost no so called AI company makes profit.
:::

Hosting cost and development costs for training a LLM are immense. And offering licenses to companies and sell LLM prompts as SAAS services are hardly enough for a healthy revenue. 

The danger is that most AI companies will sell your data as a revenue stream. This besides selling ads injected in prompts.

The companies that make profit are the traditional service companies or product companies that long before LLMs existed already had a healthy business model. For many companies the latest technology options for using AI and LLMs can be profitable. See the section on [business use cases](ml-business-use).
