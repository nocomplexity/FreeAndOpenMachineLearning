Natural Language Processing
===========================

Introduction
------------

A real tangible and still the most applied use case for machine learning
is natural language processing (NLP). Many businesses use cases for
machine learning are based on information. This can be input or
processed information. In fact most business use cases that can benefit
of machine learning have nothing to do with images or video. Most
business do have information of customers in digital form available and
want to use this data to develop more value added services for their
customers.

Everything that has to do with text processing and involves machine
learning can be categorized as Natural Language Processing (NLP).

NLP is concerned with programming computers to process natural language.
NLP is at the intersection of computer science, machine learning and
linguistics. The most innovative form of NLP are applications that use
using the latest machine learning technologies to derive meaning from
human languages. NLP is something that's been part of our lives for
decades. In fact, consumers from across the globe interact with NLP on a
daily basis, without even realizing it. But with more FOSS machine
learning building blocks available even with the latest machine learning
algorithm, also NLP innovation is growing rapidly.

NLP technology is important for scientific, economic, social, and
cultural reasons. Computers that can communicate with humans as humans
do are a holy grail. Including understanding context and emotions. Due
to infinite number of cultures solving this problem has proven to be
hard. Communication is not only verbal. Nonverbal is the significant
part of communication. Nonverbal communication is the nonlinguistic
transmission of information through visual, auditory, tactile, and
kinesthetic (physical) channels.

NLP is experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are
deployed in a variety of new machine learning technologies.

More and more NLP techniques are used products that have serious impact
on our daily lives. A misinterpreted pronounced word like 'stop' can
have several meanings when used within an autonomous driving car. Maybe
you just meant to warn your children instead of stopping the vehicle on
a dangerous intersection.

Creating good NLP based applications using machine learning is hard. A
simple test that gives an indication of the quality is to use a the
sentence "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo
buffalo". This sentence is correct. But many NLP algorithms and
applications cannot handle this very well. Similar sentences exist in
other languages. We humans are by nature good with complicated
linguistic constructs, but many NLP algorithms still fail with this
simple example. Some background information on this sentence can be
found on Wikipedia
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo>
)

Basic NLP functions
-------------------

NLP is able to do all kinds of basic text functions. A short overview:

-   Text Classification (e.g. document categorization).
-   Finding words with the same meaning for search.
-   Understanding how much time it take to read a text.
-   Understanding how difficult it is to read is a text.
-   Identifying the language of a text.
-   Generating a summary of a text.
-   Finding similar documents.
-   Identifying entities (e.g., cities, people, locations) in a text.
-   Translating a text.
-   Text Generation.

Machine learning capabilities have proven to be very useful for
improving typical NLP based use cases. This is due to the fact that text
in digital format is widely available and machine learning algorithms
typically perform good on large amounts of data.

NLP papers and NLP software comes with a typical terminology:

-   Tokenizer: Splitting the text into words or phrases.
-   Stemming and lemmatization. Normalizing words so that different
    forms map to the canonical word with the same meaning. For example,
    \"running\" and \"ran\" map to \"run.\"
-   Entity extraction: Identifying subjects in the text.
-   Part of speech detection: Identifying text as a verb, noun,
    participle, verb phrase, and so on.
-   Sentence boundary detection: Detecting complete sentences within
    paragraphs of text.

To create NLP enabled applications you need to set up a \'pipeline\' for
the various software building blocks. For each step in a NLP development
pipeline another FOSS building block can be needed. The figure below
shows a typical NLP pipeline.

In the figure below a typical NLP architecture for providing input on
common user questions. A lot of Bot systems (Build--operate--transfer)
or FAQ answering systems are created with no machine learning algorithms
at all. Often simple keyword extraction is done and a simple match in a
database is performed. More state-of-the-art NLP systems make intensive
use of machine learning algorithms. The general rule is: If a
application should be user friendly and value added than learning
algorithms are needed, since it is no longer possible to program output
based on given input.

NLP Business challenges
-----------------------

When using NLP technology to extract information and insight from text,
the starting point is typically the raw documents stored on websites,
unstructured documents and structured documents. Also the fact that
documents are stored in a variety of formats, like PDF, MSword, TIFFs
make that the time needed before text can be send towards an algorithm
long and often manual intensive. Even the most advanced web scraping
techniques (software to store raw text of websites) is manual intensive.
Unstructured text must be structured first before using these text for a
NLP driven application is possible.

Privacy is a large concern when dealing with documents. To comply with
the GDPR (in EU) using text with personal information of e.g. customers
for other purposes is often not allowed without explicit permission of
the owners of the personal data.

NLP Business Examples
---------------------

NLP enabled application make a good fit for businesses where analysing
or processing text is done at large. Below some example NLP business use
cases.

-   Social media monitoring:Almost all social media monitoring tools are
    basically built using NLP technology. These tools help to monitor
    social media channels for mentions of your brand, and alert you when
    consumers are talking about your brand. Real time monitoring of
    social media channels is important for companies for a lot of large
    companies, e.g. to ensure that any potential crises is noticed
    immediately.
-   Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis is a smaller subset of social
    media monitoring. It refers to monitoring the social media landscape
    and listening in on conversations and identifying opinions and
    determining whether the author of the post holds a positive,
    negative, or neutral opinion towards a brand. Using NLP sentiment
    analysis tools is it easy to filter emotionally-charged words that
    are used to describe a brand or a customer's experience with a
    brand. It is also possible to automate research on how consumers
    speak about a product or service.
-   Text analysis: Text analysis can be broken into several
    sub-categories e.g. grammatical, syntactic and semantic analyses. By
    analysing text and extracting different types of key elements (such
    as topics, people, dates, locations, companies), it is easier to
    organize data and identify useful patterns and insights.
-   Survey analytics: If you are analysing large amounts of surveys you
    can use old-skool reporting and statistical techniques. But a NLP
    based analyse makes it possible to faster and easier find patterns,
    categories and anomalies that are hard to find manual in survey
    responses with more than 20.000 responses.
-   Spam filters: Emails that contain text and words such as "free",
    "promotion", "buy now" , \'coin\' , \'offer\' , etc, have a high
    chance of being spam. With the use of NLP technology you can create
    self learning spam filters. Sometimes too good.
-   Autocomplete: With an autocomplete function it is possible to
    predicts what the next characters or words will be that you will
    enter. This makes the use of text based UI simpler.
-   Hiring Tools: Large companies still do receive many resumes,
    analysing can be time-consuming and the task of sorting
    overwhelming. Natural language processing software is able to speed
    up the process of sorting resumes. But be aware NLP software is not
    flawless. So you will miss good candidates if you only scan resumes.
-   Conversational Search: Traditional search often brings not the
    results you want. Wit conversational search the context of your
    search is taken into account. So only for the current context
    relevant search items will be presented. Since searching quality
    information is time consuming , streamlining search in real-time
    conversation NLP software will improve productivity for knowledge
    workers.
