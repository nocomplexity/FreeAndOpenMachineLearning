Machine learning is a complex technology. So we need simple and Free and Open solutions to create applications so that will solve complex problems we humans face. To trust machine learning applications there is simple no other option than using fully transparent technologies. So Free and Open in the spirit of the Free Software Foundation (https://fsf.org).
