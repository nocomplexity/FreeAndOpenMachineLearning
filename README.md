# Free and Open Machine Learning

Great that you are interested in this open collaboration project!

The latest online version can be found here: https://nocomplexity.com/documents/fossml/

This project is all about collaborative learning on applying FOSS Machine Learning.
This project is an open research project. It is open for all to join.

Since this project is a decentralized open learning project, to drive innovation, it is supported by BM-Support Foundation (https://www.bm-support.org/ ) If you are an open company, consider to join this Foundation! https://www.bm-support.org/open-company-principles/ 

This project is alive & kicking:
* Thanks to input of many freedom fighters a first version of the FOSS Machine Learning guide is created. This publication does not explain and dive into the statistics and deep mathematical algorithms behind machine learning. On purpose. The first publication covers machine learning concepts and gives you solid information to get started to work with free and open machine learning for your business use case.


# Goal of the project

**Advocate and promote FOSS machine learning.**


# Contributing and HELPING

This publication on FOSS machine learning is created to be shared as much as possible. So please share! This to make sure machine learning remains a full open technology that can be used by everyone. 

Helping is simple: Just create an issue, pull request or simple send me an email with your valuable input.

But you can also support the project by [buying a hard copy](https://www.amazon.de/Free-Machine-Learning-Maikel-Mardjan/dp/B0863S9LQ5/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=Free+and+open+machine+learning&qid=1585228714&s=books-intl-de&sr=1-4) of the FOSS Machine Learning Guide. 

If you like your name stated here: This publication is open source. Issues and pull requests are welcome.

All contributors will be added to this list.
