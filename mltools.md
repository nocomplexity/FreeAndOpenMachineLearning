## AI Explainability 360

<p> The AI Explainability 360 toolkit is an open-source library that  supports interpretability and explainability of datasets and machine  learning models. The AI Explainability 360 Python package includes a  comprehensive set of algorithms that cover different dimensions of  explanations along with proxy explainability metrics. </p>



<p>It is OSS from IBM (so apache2.0) so mind the history of openness IBM has regarding OSS product development. The documentation can be found here: <a href="https://aix360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://aix360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (opens in a new tab)">https://aix360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></p>

## Apollo

<p>Apollo is a high performance, flexible architecture which accelerates the development, testing, and deployment of Autonomous Vehicles. </p>



<p>Apollo 2.0 supports vehicles autonomously driving on simple urban roads. Vehicles are able to cruise on roads safely, avoid collisions with obstacles, stop at traffic lights, and change lanes if needed to reach their destination. </p>



<p>Apollo 5.5 enhances the complex urban road autonomous driving capabilities of previous Apollo releases, by introducing curb-to-curb driving support. With this new addition, Apollo is now a leap closer to fully autonomous urban road driving. The car has complete 360-degree visibility, along with upgraded perception deep learning model and a brand new prediction model to handle the changing conditions of complex road and junction scenarios, making the car more secure and aware.</p>

## Data Science Version Control (DVC)

<p><strong>Data Science Version Control</strong> or <strong>DVC</strong> is an <strong>open-source</strong> tool for data science and
machine learning projects. With a simple and flexible Git-like architecture and interface it
helps data scientists:</p>

## Ludwig

<p>Ludwig is a toolbox built on top of TensorFlow that allows to train  and test deep learning models without the need to write code. Ludwig provides two main functionalities: training models and using them to predict. It is based on datatype abstraction, so that the same data preprocessing and postprocessing will be performed on different datasets that share data types and the same encoding and decoding models developed for one task can be reused for different tasks.</p>



<p>All you need to provide is a CSV file containing your data, a list of
 columns to use as inputs, and a list of columns to use as outputs, 
Ludwig will do the rest.
Simple commands can be used to train models both locally and in a 
distributed way, and to use them to predict on new data.</p>



<p>A programmatic API is also available in order to use Ludwig from your python code.
A suite of visualization tools allows you to analyze models&#8217; training and test performance and to compare them.</p>



<p>Ludwig is built with extensibility principles in mind and is based on
 data type abstractions, making it easy to add support for new data 
types as well as new model architectures.</p>



<p>It can be used by practitioners to quickly train and test deep 
learning models as well as by researchers to obtain strong baselines to 
compare against and have an experimentation setting that ensures 
comparability by performing standard data preprocessing and 
visualization.</p>

## OpenML
<p>OpenML is an on-line machine learning platform for sharing and organizing data, machine learning algorithms and experiments. It claims to be designed to create a frictionless, networked ecosystem, so that you can readily integrate into your existing processes/code/environments. It also allows people from all over the world to collaborate and build directly on each other’s latest ideas, data and results, irrespective of the tools and infrastructure they happen to use. So nice ideas to build an open science movement. The people behind OpemML are mostly (data)scientist. So using this product for real world business use cases will take some extra effort.</p>
<p>Altrhough OpenML is exposed as an foundation based on openness, a quick inspection learned that the OpenML platform&#160; is not as open as you want. Also the OSS software is not created to be run on premise. So be aware when doing large (time) investments into this OpenML platform.</p>

## TensorWatch

<p>TensorWatch is a debugging and visualization tool designed for data 
science, deep learning and reinforcement learning from Microsoft 
Research. It works in Jupyter Notebook to show real-time visualizations 
of your machine learning training and perform several other key analysis
 tasks for your models and data.</p>



<p>TensorWatch is designed to be flexible and extensible so you can also
 build your own custom visualizations, UIs, and dashboards. Besides 
traditional &#8220;what-you-see-is-what-you-log&#8221; approach, it also has a 
unique capability to execute arbitrary queries against your live ML 
training process, return a stream as a result of the query and view this
 stream using your choice of a visualizer (we call this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tensorwatch#lazy-logging-mode%5D">Lazy Logging Mode</a>).</p>



<p>TensorWatch is under heavy development with a goal of providing a 
platform for debugging machine learning in one easy to use, extensible, 
and hackable package.</p>

## VisualDL
<p>VisualDL is an open-source cross-framework web dashboard that richly visualizes the performance and data flowing through your neural network training. VisualDL is a deep learning visualization tool that can help design deep learning jobs. It includes features such as scalar, parameter distribution, model structure and image visualization.</p>

## What-If Tool
<p>The <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool" rel="nofollow">What-If Tool</a> (WIT) provides an easy-to-use interface for expanding understanding of a black-box ML model. With the plugin, you can perform inference on a large set of examples and immediately visualize the results in a variety of ways. Additionally, examples can be edited manually or programatically and re-run through the model in order to see the results of the changes. It contains tooling for investigating model performance and fairness over subsets of a dataset.</p>
<p>The purpose of the tool is that give people a simple, intuitive, and powerful way to play with a trained ML model on a set of data through a visual interface with absolutely no code required.</p>
