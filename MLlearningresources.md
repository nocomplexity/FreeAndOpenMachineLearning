ML Learning resources
=====================

Learning machine learning does not have to be very expensive or time
consuming. Great learning material for machine learning is licensed
under a Creative Commons license. For starters but also people who are
already more familiar with the key concepts.

This section presents an opinionated list of great machine learning
learning resources. A lot of garbage is produced on the internet and
even paid courses are often not that good. But most material released
under an open license is of excellent quality. This list consist of very
readable references and some great hands-on courses.

Only resources that are real open, so resources published using a
Creative Commons license (cc-by mostly) or other types of real open
licensed material is included.

Most learning resources include hands-on tutorials. So be ready to use a
notebook, but most tutorials offer notebooks ready to use directly.
