Business Examples
=================

Applications for real business use of machine learning to solve real
tangible problems are growing at a rapid pace. To outline some use cases
that have been realized using machine learning technology, this
paragraph summarize some real world cases to get some inspiration. So in
this section some worth mentioning exiting real business examples for
companies that really make use of new ML solutions possible.

-   Medical researchers are using machine learning to assess a person's
    cardiovascular risk of a heart attack and stroke.
-   Air Traffic Controllers are using TensorFlow to predict flight
    routes through crowded airspace for safe and efficient landings.
-   Engineers are using TensorFlow to analyse auditory data in the
    rainforest to detect logging trucks and other illegal activities.
-   Scientists in Africa are using TensorFlow to detect diseases in
    Cassava plants to improve yield for farmers.
-   Finding free parking space. <http://www.peazy.in> has developed an
    app using machine learning to assist with finding a free parking
    space in crowded cities.
-   All kinds of card games. With the use of the FOSS RLCard toolkit
    (see open ML Software section) the use of Reinforcement Learning
    (RL) in card games is possible.
-   AI Driven Logos. An AI solution which selects the best possible
    logos for your brand based on a large number of designs it has seen
    over time. 
-   Cardiac Ultrasound Software. The software, called Caption Guidance,
    is an accessory to compatible diagnostic ultrasound systems and uses
    artificial intelligence to help the user capture images of a
    patient's heart that are of acceptable diagnostic quality. Approved
    for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
