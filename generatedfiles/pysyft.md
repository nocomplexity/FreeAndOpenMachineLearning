## Description 

PySyft enables a new way to do data science, where you can use non-public information, without seeing nor obtaining a copy of the data itself. All you need is to connect to a Datasite!

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
