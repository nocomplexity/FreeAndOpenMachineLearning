## Description 

The Apache Tikaâ„¢ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
