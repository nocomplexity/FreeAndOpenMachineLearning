# PyTorch

## Description 

PyTorch is a Python-first machine learning framework that is utilized heavily towards deep learning. It supports CUDA technology (From NVIDIA) to fully use the the power of the dedicated GPUs in training, analyzing and validating neural networks models. The Pytorch project has a lot of sub-projects and a strong community. Pytorch is the foundation layer under current LLMs.
