## Description 

tinygrad: For something between PyTorch and karpathy/micrograd. This may not be the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework. Due to its extreme simplicity, it aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training. If XLA is CISC, tinygrad is RISC.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
