# DSPy

## Description 

DSPy is the framework for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It allows you to iterate fast on building modular AI systems and offers algorithms for optimizing their prompts and weights, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
