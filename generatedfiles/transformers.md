## Description 

Transformers is a library of pretrained text, computer vision, audio, video, and multimodal models for inference and training. Use Transformers to fine-tune models on your data, build inference applications, and for generative AI use cases across multiple modalities. There are over 500K+ Transformers model checkpoints on the Hugging Face Hub you can use.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
