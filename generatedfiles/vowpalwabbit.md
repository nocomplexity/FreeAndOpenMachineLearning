# Vowpal Wabbit

## Description 

Vowpal Wabbit is a machine learning system which pushes the frontier of machine learning with techniques such as online, hashing, allreduce, reductions, learning2search, active, and interactive learning. There is a specific focus on reinforcement learning with several contextual bandit algorithms implemented and the online nature lending to the problem well. Vowpal Wabbit is a destination for implementing and maturing state of the art algorithms with performance in mind.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
